/*
  Exercise:

  Let's implement a `Person` class.
  
  Its constructor receives two strings: firstName and lastName 

  The class should implement the method `fullName` that will
  return the person's full name based on the values received on the constructor.
  
  Example:
  ```js
  const bezos = new Person('Jeff', 'Bezos')
  bezos.fullName()
  ```

  Should return:
  ```plain
  Jeff Bezos
  ```

export default class Person {
