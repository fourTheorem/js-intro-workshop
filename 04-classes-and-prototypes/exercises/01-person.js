/*
  Exercise:

  Let's implement a `Person` class.

  Its constructor receives two strings: firstName and lastName

  The class should implement the method `fullName` that will
  return the person's full name based on the values received on the constructor.

  Example:

  ```js
  const bezos = new Person('Jeff', 'Bezos')
  bezos.fullName()
  ```

  Should return:

  ```plain
  Jeff Bezos
  ```

  Test your solution with:

  > npm run ex -- 04-classes-and-prototypes/exercises/01-person.test.js
*/

export default class Person {
  // Write your code here!
}
