/*
  Exercise:

  Let's implement a `Dog` class.

  Its constructor receives a string with the dog name

  The class should implement two methods:
    * introduce: It returns a string with the content `My name is + name`
    * bark: A static method that returns the string `Woof!`

  Example:

  ```js
  const rocky = new Dog('Rocky')
  rocky.introduce()
  Dog.bark()
  ```

  Should return:

  ```plain
  My name is Rocky
  Woof!
  ```

  Test your solution with:

  > npm run ex -- 04-classes-and-prototypes/exercises/02-dog.test.js
*/

export default class Dog {
  // Write your code here!
}
