/*
  Exercise:

  Let's implement a `Dog` class.
  
  Its constructor receives a string with the dog name

  The class should implement two methods:
    * introduce: It returns a string with the content `My name is + name`
    * bark: A static method that returns the string `Woof!`
  
  Example:
  ```js
  const rocky = new Dog('Rocky')
  rocky.introduce()
  Dog.bark()
  ```

  Should return:
  ```plain
  My name is Rocky
  Woof!
  ```

export default class Dog {
    // Write your code here!
}
